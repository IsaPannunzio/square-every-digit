# Square Every Digit

# About
This is my solution to Codewars's kata "Square Every Digit".

# Instructions
Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.
