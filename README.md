# Square Every Digit

# About
This is my solution to a Codewars's kata.

# Instructions
Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.
For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.
Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer.

# How to Run
* Download JDK
* Run in the IDE of your choice
